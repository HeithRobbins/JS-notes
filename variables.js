//In order to be able to access data, to be able to store inside something and then call it later. That's essentially what variables are.


// var age = 12  // when using var you are able to change 
// let name = 'Kristine' // when using let you are not able to change 
// console.log(name) // console.log is like the same way you do it in python when using the print()
// alert(name) // this is a way so you can have it alert you with a new window popping up


// var name, city, age

// name = 'Kristine'
// city = 'Scottsdale'
// age = 12
// console.log(age)
// console.log(name)
// console.log(city)

var age = 12
// let age = 21
// const age = 40
