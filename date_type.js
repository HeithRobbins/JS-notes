// The first one were going to start with is Boolean data type

var truthy = true
var notTruthy = false
console.log(truthy)

// null data type null can only have one value and that is null

var nully = null
console.log(nully)

// next is undefined 

var notDefined
console.log(notDefined)

// number

var age = 12
console.log(age)
// This is just going to print out that value. 12 everything there works.

// Now this is where I want to take a little bit of a pause and talk about how javascript works with variables and data types much differently than many other programming languages.If you're coming to javascript from say Java or C or C++ those are called statically typed languages. In those languages, what we just did here would not work.

// The reason it would not work is because those languages typically require you to define what the data type is going to be.So the syntax would look something like this

// var age : Number = 12 \
